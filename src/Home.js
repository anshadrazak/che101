                    <p className='defs'>Forest fires are increasing in frequency and intensity, 
                    destroying ecosystems and communities around the globe. These fires not only 
                    claim lives and wildlife but also accelerate climate change by releasing massive 
                    amounts of carbon into the atmosphere.</p>

                    <b>Biodiversity at Risk:</b><br/> Forests are home to 80% of the worldâ€™s terrestrial species, and fires put this biodiversity in immediate danger.
                    <br></br><br></br><b>Human Impact:</b><br/> Communities living near forests face threats to their health, safety, and homes due to forest fires.
                    <br></br><br></br><b>Climate Change:</b><br/> Forests play a crucial role in absorbing carbon dioxide, and their loss accelerates global warming.
