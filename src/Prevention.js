                    Always ensure that campfires and bonfires are fully extinguished before leaving them. Use designated fire pits, and avoid building fires in windy or dry conditions. Never leave fires unattended, and keep water or a fire extinguisher nearby. Even a small ember can ignite dry vegetation and cause a wildfire.</p>
